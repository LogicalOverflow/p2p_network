# p2p_network
A python peer to peer network, connected through tcp connections. Early stage

What is curently possible:
- sending data over multiple nodes to anyone in the network (forwarded), using the path with the least nodes inbetween (path finding)
- broadcasting data to everyone in the network

sendable data is anything - you are sending bytes
